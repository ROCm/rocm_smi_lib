/** @defgroup PerfCntr Performance Counter Functions
 *  These functions are used to configure, query and control performance
 *  counting.
 *
 *  These functions use the same mechanisms as the "perf" command line
 *  utility. They share the same underlying resources and have some similarities
 *  in how they are used. The events supported by this API should have
 *  corresponding perf events that can be seen with "perf stat ...". The events
 *  supported by perf can be seen with "perf list"
 *
 *  The types of events available and the ability to count those
 *  events are dependent on which device is being targeted and if counters are
 *  still available for that device, respectively.
 *  ::rsmi_dev_counter_group_supported() can be used to see which event types
 *  (::rsmi_event_group_t) are supported for a given device. Assuming a device
 *  supports a given event type, we can then check to see if there are counters
 *  available to count a specific event with
 *  ::rsmi_counter_available_counters_get(). Counters may be occupied by other
 *  perf based programs.
 *
 *  Once it is determined that events are supported and counters are available,
 *  an event counter can be created/destroyed and controlled.
 *
 *  ::rsmi_dev_counter_create() allocates internal data structures that will be
 *  used to used to control the event counter, and return a handle to this data
 *  structure.
 *
 *  Once an event counter handle is obtained, the event counter can be
 *  controlled (i.e., started, stopped,...) with ::rsmi_counter_control() by
 *  passing ::rsmi_counter_command_t commands. ::RSMI_CNTR_CMD_START starts an
 *  event counter and ::RSMI_CNTR_CMD_STOP stops a counter.
 *  ::rsmi_counter_read() reads an event counter.
 *
 *  Once the counter is no longer needed, the resources it uses should be freed
 *  by calling ::rsmi_dev_counter_destroy().
 *
 *
 *  Important Notes about Counter Values
 *  ====================================
 *  - A running "absolute" counter is kept internally. For the discussion that
 *  follows, we will call the internal counter value at time \a t \a
 *  val<sub>t</sub>
 *  - Issuing ::RSMI_CNTR_CMD_START or calling ::rsmi_counter_read(), causes
 *  RSMI (in kernel) to internally record the current absolute counter value
 *  - ::rsmi_counter_read() returns the number of events that have occurred
 *  since the previously recorded value (ie, a relative value,
 *  \a val<sub>t</sub> - val<sub>t-1</sub>) from the issuing of
 *  ::RSMI_CNTR_CMD_START or calling ::rsmi_counter_read()
 *

/** @defgroup APISupport Supported Functions
 *  API function support varies by both GPU type and the version of the
 *  installed ROCm stack.  The functions described in this section can be used
 *  to determine, up front, which functions are supported for a given device
 *  on a system. If such "up front" knowledge of support for a function is not
 *  needed, alternatively, one can call a device related function and check the
 *  return code.
 *
 *  Some functions have several variations ("variants") where some variants are
 *  supported and others are not. For example, on a given device,
 *  ::rsmi_dev_temp_metric_get may support some types of temperature metrics
 *  (e.g., ::RSMI_TEMP_CRITICAL_HYST), but not others
 *  (e.g., ::RSMI_TEMP_EMERGENCY).
 *
 *  In addition to a top level of variant support for a function, a function
 *  may have varying support for monitors/sensors. These are considered
 *  "sub-variants" in functions described in this section. Continuing the
 *  ::rsmi_dev_temp_metric_get example, if variant
 *  ::RSMI_TEMP_CRITICAL_HYST is supported, perhaps
 *  only the sub-variant sensors ::RSMI_TEMP_TYPE_EDGE
 *  and ::RSMI_TEMP_TYPE_EDGE are supported, but not
 *  ::RSMI_TEMP_TYPE_MEMORY.
 *
 *  In cases where a function takes in a sensor id parameter but does not have
 *  any "top level" variants, the functions in this section will indicate a
 *  default "variant", ::RSMI_DEFAULT_VARIANT, for the top level variant, and
 *  the various monitor support will be sub-variants of this.
 *
 *  The functions in this section use the "iterator" concept to list which
 *  functions are supported; to list which variants of the supported functions
 *  are supported; and finally which monitors/sensors are supported for a
 *  variant.
 *
 *  Here is example code that prints out all supported functions, their
 *  supported variants and sub-variants. Please see the related descriptions
