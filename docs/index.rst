****************************************************
ROCm System Management Interface (ROCm SMI) library
****************************************************

The ROCm System Management Interface library, or ROCm SMI library, is part of the ROCm software stack. It is a C library for Linux that provides a user space interface for applications to monitor and control GPU applications.

For more information, refer to `GitHub. <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib>`_

.. NOTE::

The AMD System Management Interface Library (AMD SMI library) is a C library for Linux that provides a user space interface for applications to monitor and control AMD devices. This library will replace rocm_smi_lib over time. We recommend that users transition to the AMD SMI library.

For more information, refer to the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ROCm/amdsmi>`_.
