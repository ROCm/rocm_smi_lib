# Radeon Open Compute (ROCm) - System Management Interface - Command Line Tool

This tool acts as a command line interface for manipulating
and monitoring the amdgpu kernel, and is intended to replace
and deprecate the existing rocm_smi.py CLI tool.
It uses Ctypes to call the rocm_smi_lib API.
Recommended: At least one AMD GPU with ROCm driver installed
Required: ROCm SMI library installed (librocm_smi64)

## Installation

Follow installation procedure for rocm_smi_lib.
Please refer to [https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm_smi_lib](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm_smi_lib) for the installation guide.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH  should be set to the folder containing librocm_smi64.

## Version

The SMI will report two "versions", ROCM-SMI version and other is ROCM-SMI-LIB version.  
- ROCM-SMI version is the CLI/tool version number with commit ID appended after + sign.  
- ROCM-SMI-LIB version is the library package version number.
```
ROCM-SMI version: 2.0.0+8e78352
ROCM-SMI-LIB version: 6.1.0
```

--setsclk/--setmclk # [# # ...]:
    This allows you to set a mask for the levels. For example, if a GPU has 8 clock levels,
    you can set a mask to use levels 0, 5, 6 and 7 with --setsclk 0 5 6 7 . This will only
    use the base level, and the top 3 clock levels. This will allow you to keep the GPU at
    base level when there is no GPU load, and the top 3 levels when the GPU load increases.

    NOTES:
        The clock levels will change dynamically based on GPU load based on the default
        Compute and Graphics profiles. The thresholds and delays for a custom mask cannot
        be controlled through the SMI tool

        This flag automatically sets the Performance Level to "manual" as the mask is not
        applied when the Performance level is set to auto

--setfan LEVEL:
    This sets the fan speed to a value ranging from 0 to maxlevel, or from 0%-100%

    If the level ends with a %, the fan speed is calculated as pct*maxlevel/100
        (maxlevel is usually 255, but is determined by the ASIC)

    NOTE: While the hardware is usually capable of overriding this value when required, it is
          recommended to not set the fan level lower than the default value for extended periods
          of time

--setperflevel LEVEL:
    This lets you use the pre-defined Performance Level values for clocks and power profile, which can include:
        auto (Automatically change values based on GPU workload)
        low (Keep values low, regardless of workload)
        high (Keep values high, regardless of workload)
        manual (Only use values defined by --setsclk and --setmclk)

--setoverdrive/--setmemoverdrive #:
    ***DEPRECATED IN NEWER KERNEL VERSIONS (use --setslevel/--setmlevel instead)***
    This sets the percentage above maximum for the max Performance Level.
    For example, --setoverdrive 20 will increase the top sclk level by 20%, similarly
    --setmemoverdrive 20 will increase the top mclk level by 20%. Thus if the maximum
    clock level is 1000MHz, then --setoverdrive 20 will increase the maximum clock to 1200MHz

    NOTES:
        This option can be used in conjunction with the --setsclk/--setmclk mask

        Operating the GPU outside of specifications can cause irreparable damage to your hardware
        Please observe the warning displayed when using this option

        This flag automatically sets the clock to the highest level, as only the highest level is
        increased by the OverDrive value

--setpoweroverdrive/--resetpoweroverdrive #:
    This allows users to change the maximum power available to a GPU package.
    The input value is in Watts. This limit is enforced by the hardware, and
    some cards allow users to set it to a higher value than the default that
    ships with the GPU. This Power OverDrive mode allows the GPU to run at
    higher frequencies for longer periods of time, though this may mean the
    GPU uses more power than it is allowed to use per power supply
    specifications. Each GPU has a model-specific maximum Power OverDrive that
    is will take; attempting to set a higher limit than that will cause this
    command to fail.

    NOTES:
        Operating the GPU outside of specifications can cause irreparable damage to your hardware
        Please observe the warning displayed when using this option

--setprofile SETPROFILE:
    The Compute Profile accepts 1 or n parameters, either the Profile to select (see --showprofile for a list
    of preset Power Profiles) or a quoted string of values for the CUSTOM profile.
    NOTE: These values can vary based on the ASIC, and may include:

| Setting             | Description                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| SCLK_PROFILE_ENABLE | Whether or not to apply the 3 following SCLK settings (0=disable,1=enable) |
|                     | **NOTE: This is a hidden field. If set to 0, the following 3 values are displayed as '-’** |
| SCLK_UP_HYST        | Delay before sclk is increased (in milliseconds)   |
| SCLK_DOWN_HYST      | Delay before sclk is decresed (in milliseconds)    |
| SCLK_ACTIVE_LEVEL   | Workload required before sclk levels change (in %) |
| MCLK_PROFILE_ENABLE | Whether or not to apply the 3 following MCLK settings (0=disable,1=enable) |
|                     | **NOTE: This is a hidden field. If set to 0, the following 3 values are displayed as '-'** |
| MCLK_UP_HYST        | Delay before mclk is increased (in milliseconds)   |
| MCLK_DOWN_HYST      | Delay before mclk is decresed (in milliseconds)    |
| MCLK_ACTIVE_LEVEL   | Workload required before mclk levels change (in %) |

      Other settings:

| Setting          | Description                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BUSY_SET_POINT   | Threshold for raw activity level before levels change                     |
| FPS              | Frames Per Second                                                         |
| USE_RLC_BUSY     | When set to 1, DPM is switched up as long as RLC busy message is received |
| MIN_ACTIVE_LEVEL | Workload required before levels change (in %)                             |

    NOTES:
        When a compute queue is detected, the COMPUTE Power Profile values will be automatically
        applied to the system, provided that the Perf Level is set to "auto"

        The CUSTOM Power Profile is only applied when the Performance Level is set to "manual"
        so using this flag will automatically set the performance level to "manual"

        It is not possible to modify the non-CUSTOM Profiles. These are hard-coded by the kernel

-P, --showpower:
Show average or instantaneous socket graphics package power consumption

"Graphics Package" refers to the GPU plus any HBM (High-Bandwidth memory) modules, if present

-M, --showmaxpower:
Show the maximum Graphics Package power that the GPU will attempt to consume.
This limit is enforced by the hardware.

--loglevel:
This will allow the user to set a logging level for the SMI's actions. Currently this is
only implemented for sysfs writes, but can easily be expanded upon in the future to log
other things from the SMI

--showmeminfo:
This allows the user to see the amount of used and total memory for a given block (vram,
vis_vram, gtt). It returns the number of bytes used and total number of bytes for each block
'all' can be passed as a field to return all blocks, otherwise a quoted-string is used for
multiple values (e.g. "vram vis_vram")
vram refers to the Video RAM, or graphics memory, on the specified device
vis_vram refers to Visible VRAM, which is the CPU-accessible video memory on the device
gtt refers to the Graphics Translation Table

-b, --showbw:
This shows an approximation of the number of bytes received and sent by the GPU over
the last second through the PCIe bus. Note that this will not work for APUs since data for
the GPU portion of the APU goes through the memory fabric and does not 'enter/exit'
the chip via the PCIe interface, thus no accesses are generated, and the performance
counters can't count accesses that are not generated.
NOTE: It is not possible to easily grab the size of every packet that is transmitted
in real time, so the kernel estimates the bandwidth by taking the maximum payload size (mps),
which is the max size that a PCIe packet can be. and multiplies it by the number of packets
received and sent. This means that the SMI will report the maximum estimated bandwidth,
the actual usage could (and likely will be) less

--showrasinfo:
This shows the RAS information for a given block. This includes enablement of the block
(currently GFX, SDMA and UMC are the only supported blocks) and the number of errors
ue - Uncorrectable errors
ce - Correctable errors

## Clock Type Descriptions

| Clock type | Description |
| ---------- | --- |
| DCEFCLK    | DCE (Display) |
| FCLK       | Data fabric (VG20 and later) - Data flow from XGMI, Memory, PCIe |
| SCLK       | GFXCLK (Graphics core) |
|            | **Note - SOCCLK split from SCLK as of Vega10. Pre-Vega10 they were both controlled by SCLK** |
| MCLK       | GPU Memory (VRAM) |
| PCLK       | PCIe bus |
|            | **Note - This gives 2 speeds, PCIe Gen1 x1 and the highest available based on the hardware** |
| SOCCLK     | System clock (VG10 and later) - Data Fabric (DF), MM HUB, AT HUB, SYSTEM HUB, OSS, DFD |
|            | **Note - DF split from SOCCLK as of Vega20. Pre-Vega20 they were both controlled by SOCCLK** |

--gpureset:
This flag will attempt to reset the GPU for a specified device. This will invoke the GPU reset through
the kernel debugfs file amdgpu_gpu_recover. Note that GPU reset will not always work, depending on the
manner in which the GPU is hung.

--showdriverversion:
This flag will print out the AMDGPU module version for amdgpu-pro or ROCm kernels. For other kernels,
it will simply print out the name of the kernel (`uname -r`)

--showserial:
This flag will print out the serial number for the graphics card
    NOTE: This is currently only supported on Vega20 server cards that support it. Consumer cards and
          cards older than Vega20 will not support this feature.

--showproductname:
This uses the pci.ids file to print out more information regarding the GPUs on the system.
'update-pciids' may need to be executed on the machine to get the latest PCI ID snapshot,
as certain newer GPUs will not be present in the stock pci.ids file, and the file may even
be absent on certain OS installation types

--showpagesinfo | --showretiredpages | --showpendingpages | --showunreservablepages:
These flags display the different "bad pages" as reported by the kernel. The three
types of pages are:
Retired pages (reserved pages) - These pages are reserved and are unable to be used
Pending pages - These pages are pending for reservation, and will be reserved/retired
Unreservable pages - These pages are not reservable for some reason

--showmemuse | --showuse | --showmeminfo:
--showuse and --showmemuse are used to indicate how busy the respective blocks are. For
example, for --showuse (gpu_busy_percent sysfs file), the SMU samples every ms or so to see
if any GPU block (RLC, MEC, PFP, CP) is busy. If so, that's 1 (or high). If not, that's 0 (low).
If we have 5 high and 5 low samples, that means 50% utilization (50% GPU busy, or 50% GPU use).
The windows and sampling vary from generation to generation, but that is how GPU and VRAM use
is calculated in a generic sense.
--showmeminfo (and VRAM% in concise output) will show the amount of VRAM used (visible, total, GTT),
as well as the total available for those partitions. The percentage shown there indicates the
amount of used memory in terms of current allocations

## OverDrive settings

Enabling OverDrive requires both a card that support OverDrive and a driver parameter that enables its use.
Because OverDrive features can damage your card, most workstation and server GPUs cannot use OverDrive.
Consumer GPUs that can use OverDrive must enable this feature by setting bit 14 in the amdgpu driver's
ppfeaturemask module parameter

For OverDrive functionality, the OverDrive bit (bit 14) must be enabled (by default, the
OverDrive bit is disabled on the ROCK and upstream kernels). This can be done by setting
amdgpu.ppfeaturemask accordingly in the kernel parameters, or by changing the default value
inside amdgpu_drv.c (if building your own kernel).

As an example, if the ppfeaturemask is set to 0xffffbfff (11111111111111111011111111111111),
then enabling the OverDrive bit would make it 0xffffffff (11111111111111111111111111111111).

These are the flags that require OverDrive functionality to be enabled for the flag to work:
    --showclkvolt
    --showvoltagerange
    --showvc
    --showsclkrange
    --showmclkrange
    --setslevel
    --setmlevel
    --setoverdrive
    --setpoweroverdrive
    --resetpoweroverdrive
    --setvc
    --setsrange
    --setmrange
